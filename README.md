# chrome-follow-clean-link
Chrome Extension for removing URL parameters from links

To install:
Easy: Download `/dist` folder, open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), enable Developer mode, and drag dist folder to page

In case I haven't built before pushing:
- clone repository
- run `npm run build`, and copy `/dist` folder to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) page
